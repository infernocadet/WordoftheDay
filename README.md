# Word of the Day

## Description
Word of the Day is my first attempt at using APIs and requests to scrape a daily word from a dictionary API and then send it to a phone number every day. 

I don't really know what I am doing yet but I will record my progress and learning here.

### Understanding APIs
API (Application Programming Interface) allows our apps to communicate with other services. In this case, we will use an API to fetch the Word of the Day. Most APIs are RESTful APIs which operate over HTTP requests.

Basic API request
- Basic request involves sending an HTTP request to an API's endpoint (URL) and then processing the response
- Python has a ```requests``` library which simplifies these steps.
